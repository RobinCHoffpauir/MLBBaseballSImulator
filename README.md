Describe 5 basic tai chi moves in an easy to understand and detailed way

Opening Move (Wu Ji):
The opening move helps you establish a strong foundation, promotes relaxation, and enhances awareness of your body's alignment.
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, parallel to each other.
Keep your knees slightly bent, arms relaxed and hanging by your sides.
Tuck your chin in slightly, and lengthen the back of your neck.
Relax your shoulders, and allow your chest to sink inwards.
Focus on deep, slow, and even breathing through your nose.
Shift your weight to your right foot, lift your left heel, and then place it down gently. Repeat on the other side.
Parting the Wild Horse's Mane (Ye Ma Fen Zong):
This move helps improve balance, coordination, and leg strength.
Begin in the opening move (Wu Ji) position.
Shift your weight to the right foot and step forward with your left foot, heel first.
As you shift your weight to your left foot, raise your hands to shoulder height, palms facing down.
Turn your left hand so the palm faces up, and lower your right hand, palm facing down.
Extend your left arm forward, while your right arm moves back and down, in a smooth and continuous motion.
Shift your weight back, and return to the starting position. Repeat on the other side.
Wave Hands Like Clouds (Yun Shou):
This move promotes flexibility and coordination while helping to calm the mind.
Begin in the opening move (Wu Ji) position.
Turn your waist to the left, shifting your weight to your left foot.
Raise your right hand to shoulder height, palm facing inward, and your left hand down near your hip, palm facing upward.
As you turn your waist to the right, gently move your hands horizontally across your body, with the right hand moving down and the left hand moving up.
When your hands cross, switch their positions (right palm now facing up and left palm facing down), and continue the movement to the other side.
Repeat the movement back and forth, synchronizing it with your breath and waist rotation.
Brush Knee and Push (Lou Xi Ao Bu):
This move helps to develop leg strength, balance, and coordination.
Begin in the opening move (Wu Ji) position.
Step forward with your left foot, heel first, while turning your waist to the left.
Raise your left hand to shoulder height, palm facing down, and your right hand down near your hip, palm facing up.
As you shift your weight to your left foot, rotate your waist back to the center, and simultaneously "brush" your left knee with your right hand.
Push forward with your left hand, palm facing outwards, as your right hand moves back to your hip.
Return to the starting position and repeat on the other side.
Grasp the Bird's Tail (Lan Que Wei):
This move involves a series of movements that help develop balance, leg strength, and overall body coordination.
Begin in the opening move (Wu Ji) position.
Step forward with your left foot, heel first, and shift your weight to that foot.
Raise both hands to shoulder height, palms facing down.
Turn your right hand palm up, and bring it across your body, while your left hand moves down, palm facing down.
Shift your weight back to your right foot, and draw your left hand in a circular motion to meet your right hand at the center of your body, palms facing each other.
