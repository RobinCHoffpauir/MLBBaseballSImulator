MLB Game Simulator
This MLB Game Simulator is a Python-based program that simulates Major League Baseball games based on user-defined team lineups and starting pitchers. The simulation uses basic probability models for at-bats and runs scored, making it a fun and interactive way to explore hypothetical matchups between teams.

## Features
User-defined team lineups and starting pitchers
Basic probability models for at-bats and runs scored
Text-based interface to input team and player information
Simple output displaying the winner and final score
Dependencies
Python 3.6+
pybaseball library
Installation
Install Python 3.6 or higher if you haven't already: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install the pybaseball library by running the following command:

## Copy code
pip install pybaseball
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

## Usage
Navigate to the directory containing the MLB Game Simulator script.

Run the script using the following command:

Copy code
python game_simulator.py
Follow the prompts to enter team names, player names for both teams, and starting pitcher names. The program will fetch player and pitcher statistics using the pybaseball library.

The simulation will run, and the winner and final score will be displayed at the end.

## Customization
The current implementation uses basic probability models for at-bats and runs scored. You can further customize and improve the simulation by:

Enhancing the probability models to include more factors, such as park factors, weather conditions, and more detailed player and pitcher statistics.
Adding more features like baserunner advancement, stolen bases, and fielding.
Incorporating historical player and team data to simulate classic games or hypothetical matchups between teams from different eras.
